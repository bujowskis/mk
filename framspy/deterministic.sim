# Parameter values that make the evaluation of a Framsticks creature deterministic.
# The values turn off random noise, so evaluation of the same genotype will always yield the same performance.
# The advantage is that you do not need to evaluate a genotype many times, and performance values are reliable.
# The disadvantage is that evolved creatures are "overfitting", i.e. rely entirely on the specific environment,
# and their behavior may be different in any other environment or (even slightly) changed conditions or parameter values,
# so each creature evolved using these settings must be later inspected using exactly the same setup.
