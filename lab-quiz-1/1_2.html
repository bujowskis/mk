<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">As you can see, the <strong>f9</strong> representation is very simple. It does not allow to describe a neural network at all, and the structure itself consists of perpendicular elements of the same length. Assuming that structures with different element lengths and angles are also possible in general, the genotype-phenotype mapping ("embryogenesis") denoted as <strong>f9</strong> is very restrictive.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Crossing over of two <strong>f9</strong> genotypes is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_(genetic_algorithm)#One-point_crossover">one-point crossover</a>, while mutation has one parameter: "mutation intensity" – the fraction of genes (symbols, letters), which during the mutation of a genotype will be replaced with random ones. In the special case when this fraction is set to zero, <u>exactly one gene</u> will always be changed. The source code for the mutation and crossover can be found <a href="http://www.framsticks.com/trac/framsticks/browser/cpp/frams/genetics/f9/f9_oper.cpp">here</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">We are about to test in practice what effects different values of this single mutation parameter have on the efficiency of evolution. The percentage of individuals subject to crossover and mutation itself is fixed and unchangeable – we are only testing the "intensity of the mutation operator" (how many genes in the genotype each mutation changes). Let's say that the optimization criterion will be the vertical position of the center of gravity of the structure. Before conducting experiments, first hypothesize: what do you expect? In general, will the "mutation intensity" significantly affect the process of the evolution of structures and the final results, and if so, how? Describe your prediction in your answer and justify it (this answer is not graded – it serves as a reference for further experimental verification).<br></p>
